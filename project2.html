                           <p>The solution must display a list of students. The list is intended
                                for administrators to get a quick overview of the 
                               students in the current year, and sort, filter, and search for certain properties.</p>

                           <p>The administrator must be able to sort the list on at least first,
                                and last names. Also a kind of sort, that would group e.g. students in the same house,
                                 or those with certain responsibilities (could be quidditch-players, -captains, prefects,
                                  or club memberships).

                           <p>The administrator must be able to filter the view, so only students from one house is shown.
                                Also, filters that only showed those with certain responsibilities.

                            The administrator must be able to quickly search for a student, e.g. by first name or last name.
                             A search field,
                             that immediately limits the listed students to those matching the search criteria

                                and adds it to another list of expelled students.
                                Once expelled, a student cannot return to the original list.</p>

                            The user must be able to make any student a prefect, and also revoke the prefect-status at any time.
                             There must be some sort of system to prevent more than two prefects from each house</p>

                               This is an indication of whether the student is from a pure wizarding family,
                                or from a half-wizard, half-muggle family, or just plain muggle.</p>

                           <p>The user must be able to appoint students to the inquisitorial squad, and remove them again. Any number of students can be appointed,
                                but only pure-blood or students from Slytherin (should any non-pure-blood be in that house).</p>

                            Create a function called hackTheSystem() that performs, or activates,
                             the hacking when called. You can add a secret button or keystroke that the user can enter to hack 
                             the system,
                             but it must also be possible to do from the console. 
                             Hacking must result in (atleast) three things happening
                             <br>
